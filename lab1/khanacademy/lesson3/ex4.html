<!-- Create a web page with your favorite recipes! The recipe book should have a table of contents linking to 
    each recipe below, using internal links. Each recipe should have a table for the ingredients, a list of 
    details, and a list and/or paragraphs of the steps required. If you use recipes from the internet, 
    be sure to add a link to the website.

Use CSS to style the recipe book, using a mix of the simple selectors and colors that you've learned.

Tip: Can't find the images you want in our image selector? You can also bring in images from Wikipedia. 
To do that, use a site-restricted Google search, then click "View image" on the result you like, 
and copy the URL into your <img> tag.

Contains at least three recipes.
Has three internal links in the table of contents that correctly jump to the specified recipe below.
Has a list for each recipe.
Has a table with at least 2 rows for each recipe.
Has steps described in paragraphs and/or lists.
Uses at least 2 CSS element selectors.
Uses at least 1 CSS id or class selector.
