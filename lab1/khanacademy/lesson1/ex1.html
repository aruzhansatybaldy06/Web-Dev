    <h1> Aruka's Poem</h1>
    <h2> Hello! I am Aruka <br>
    And this is my poem: <br>
    </h2>
    <h3> (actually not mine, i just found it in Google) <br> 
    (but i copied only the poem, i am writing an HTML file by myself :)
    </h3>
    <p> I wake up every day with your smile on my mind. <br>
It's a beautiful sight to behold, so soft and so kind. <br>
My dreams are filled with the thought of me and you. <br>
I awake and smile, for my dreams have come true. <br>
I have you to guide me through my troubles and fears. <br>
I'll always be here for you through your struggles and tears. <br>
I love you more than my words could ever show. <br>
You mean everything to me; I just want you to know. <br>
I'll be here for you no matter the dilemma. <br>
You will always be first on my agenda. <br>
 </p>
    <h2> Thanks! </h2>
