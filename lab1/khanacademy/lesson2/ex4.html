        <h2 class="bigtexts"> Hawaiʻi Welcomes You! </h2>
        <p>Hawaii is a beautiful state made up of <strong> 7 inhabited islands </strong>, 4 of which are the most popular destinations: Hawaii (The Big Island), <em> Maui, Oahu, and Kauai.</em> To plan your trip, consider the dates that work for you and whether you prefer to go during the dry or wet season. Choosing the island (or islands) you want to go to will also help you draft a budget for yourself and your fellow travelers. Flying isn’t cheap, so booking your flight and accommodations early is usually the best choice. Checking the weather a day or two before you leave will help you pack appropriate clothing and gear. Once you’re in Hawaii, kick back and enjoy the stunning natural beauty and friendly <strong><em>“Aloha Spirit!”</em></strong></p>
